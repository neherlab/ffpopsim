## 2022-11-22 -- v3.1.0: add support to track genealogies with samples from multiple time points

  * Previously, all sampled taxa in the tree had to be from the last generation. When studying viral evolution one often wants to sample over time. At each generation, a certain number randomly chosen nodes are marked as `sampled` and not pruned from the tree as evolution proceeds. the final tree will then contain these samples and store their sequences. This functionality was implemented a long time ago and was new resurrected.
