DEPENDENCIES
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Make is used to build the FFPopSim library. FFPopSim depends on the 
GNU Scientific Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
and BOOST (http://www.boost.org/). The python wrapper requires
NumPy, SciPy, and MatPlotLib (http://www.scipy.org). 


-------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For the impatient ones
-------------------------------------------------------------------
make

and have a look in the pkg folder.

Full instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Please open the Makefile and have a look at the first few lines. The
script tries to be smart about your platform and Python installation,
but is expected to fail in most cases, so please set the required
variables in the Makefile according to your operating system.

You can build the various pieces separately:

1. To build only the C++ sources, call

make src

2. To build also the Python bindings, call

make python

3. To build the documentation, call

make doc

4. To build the C++ test programs, call

make tests

To build all of them, just call

make

The C++ library and the Python module files are stored in the pkg
folder. Copy them into your system folders (e.g., /usr/local/lib and
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages) to make them available to all
users.

Examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------
C++ and Python examples are available in the tests folder. They are
commented, so you should be able to understand what it's being done
there by reading the code directly.
